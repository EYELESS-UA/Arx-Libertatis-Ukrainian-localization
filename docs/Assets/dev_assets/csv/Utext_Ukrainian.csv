"system_Quest_log_destroy_meteor_for_good","The meteor withstood my attack. It is stronger than expected. I must ask Felnor about this and explain to him what happened."
"system_Quest_log_krahoz_zohark","I need to find Krahoz and Zohark in order to stop the meteor from draining mana from my body. This is the only way to destroy this meteor and stop Akbaa from reincarnating himself in Arx."
"system_Quest_log_krahoz","Krahoz has been stolen by a group of rebels. The same people who killed the Queen and kidnapped the King's daughter. I must find a way to locate them."
"system_Quest_log_zohark","Zohark is kept by the Order of the Edurneum. I must try knocking at their door - I am sure they will understand the vital importance of my quest."
"system_Quest_log_Shield","I came across the girl I rescued in the Temple of Akbaa. I was surprised to discover that she is in fact the leader of the rebels. But this is not important. All I know is that she will give me Krahoz if I find a shield for her. It is called the Shield of the Ancients and it can be found in the 2nd level of the crypt."
"system_Quest_log_Shield_done","I have the mighty Shield of the Ancients."
"system_Quest_log_mythril_done","The ultimate weapon is now mine."
"system_Quest_log_krahoz_done","I have Krahoz."
"system_Quest_log_zohark_done","I have Zohark."
"system_Quest_log_Meteor_time","Now that I have both Krahoz and Zohark, it is time for me to return to the Temple of Akbaa and destroy this meteor once and for all."
"system_Quest_log_Meteor_destroyed","The meteor has been destroyed - Akbaa's scheming is over. Yet, oddly enough, Sylib Nurath has not called me back to the Noden. I must return to the Kingdom and see if I can find a way to get back to the Noden."
"system_Quest_log_save_kingdom","The people from the kingdom of Arx are kept prisoner by the Ylsides. I must go to the jail and see what it is all about before I can leave Arx and return to the Noden."
"system_Quest_log_super_weapon","The kingdom is restored. The trap set by Iserbius has failed. Now I know why I was not called back to the Noden: my mission is not yet complete. Akbaa had time to gather enough energy before I destroyed the meteor. Destroying the meteor was still the best thing to do, as Akbaa won't be as strong as he expected. He is probably merging with Iserbius at this very moment. It's a long process and most weapons will have no effect on Iserbius during it. I must create the ultimate weapon before I can face Akbaa."
"system_Quest_log_mythril","The book of the ultimate weapon says I should make a weapon out of mithril, as it is the only metal that will meld with strange alloys such as Koltk powder. I hope this is true."
"system_Quest_log_Dragon_egg","I must find a dragon's egg to cast a spell on the weapon."
"system_Quest_log_final_meeting","The time has come for me to fulfil my mission: I will go to the Ylside bunker now and destroy Iserbius... or should I say Akbaa."
"system_Quest_log_key_bank","I found a sealed key in Alicia's house. If only I could find a way to make a cast of it, I could make a replica of the key..."
"system_Quest_log_key_bank_done","I made a replica of the key in Alicia's house..."
"system_Quest_log_olivier","I heard a rumor at the tavern about a treasure hunt organized by a hermit called Oliver. Apparently, the way to start the hunt off is to drop an emerald into his chest."
"system_Quest_log_olivier_done","I solved the treasure hunt organized by Oliver."
"system_Quest_log_Florence","I met a ghost today. She asked me to find the people responsible for her death. She says she used to be an important person in Arx. She also said that her murderer had only one eye."
"system_Quest_log_Florence_done","The ghost mystery has been solved. Carlo was at the origin of the murder of Queen Florence."
"system_Quest_log_dragon_scale","How many scales can a dragon have? I must find information about that."
"system_Quest_water_clan","The goblin water clan asked me to kill the earth clan. In exchange, they will give me a magic item."
"system_Quest_water_clan_done","I killed the earth clan."

The best way, and the only way I know, in fact, is to plunge a stake deep into the undead's body before it gets up again. That way, it will be destroyed for good.

"book_guardpost_content","- Year 266, White Season, Week of the Rat, Third Day.*Today, a little band of goblins tried to attack our out-post. They were drunk and easy to defeat. We have therefore concluded that this was not a planned attack, but that it was due to the huge amounts of alcohol they had consumed. We fought off this attack without much difficulty, but nevertheless lost one of our men, compared to five losses on the goblins' side.*- Year 266, White Season, Week of the Mole, Second Day.*An earthquake shook our outpost to the foundations for at least ten minutes. No damage was done, but I spotted a number of cracks in the passage that leads to our city.**- Year 266, Green Season, Week of the Cow, Fourth Day.*A strange assailant attacked us this morning. He was wearing heavy armor crafted as no other we have ever seen and he seemed to be invincible. Every movement he made was incredibly precise and his speed was unrivalled. He did not know the meaning of mercy, for he killed one of my men and seriously injured two more before simply turning and leaving as quickly as he appeared. His behavior made me suspect that he was sent to establish how strong we were.*I think this warrior is merely the first visible sign of a force which is currently growing in the safety of the shadows and which will one day be powerful enough to annihilate every last one of us.***- Year 266, Green Season, Week of the Eagle, First Day.*The strange warrior returned. He killed three of my men before I finally managed to kill him. And then, as he lay in the throes of death, he burst into powerful and demonic laughter. I suspected something immediately and ordered my men to retreat as fast as they could. There was a massive explosion which scattered his remains far and wide.*No trace of him was left save his dagger lying on the ground.***- Year 266, Yellow Season, Week of the Serpent, First Day.*We were woken early this morning by an earthquake. One of my men informed me that this quake caused a landslide in the passageway that leads to the castle. I am sure help will be here soon. I prefer to wait a while before sending one of my men to bring the news to our beloved King. They are probably aware that the landslide will have consequences for us...*May the gods watch over us."
"description_book_beloved","My beloved Akbaa."
"book_beloved_content","These writings are created in honor of my master and Lord:*Akbaa.***********Akbaa is the source of knowledge across the universe and all the known dimensions. Establishing contact with his cult was a momentous occasion for our people and marks the point of no return. Worship Akbaa or perish.**Because Akbaa is a god, who also symbolizes the power of destruction of everything in the world, he knows how to reward the most loyal of his servants with great powers and punishes all others without mercy. Akbaa is immortal, however he needs souls to maintain power over the known universe, collecting souls allows him to spread his wisdom far and wide.**A good way to please Akbaa is to offer him impious souls who refuse to obey him. Although non-believers are our preferred targets, some of us are keen to enter into communion with Akbaa and offer ourselves in sacrifice. After all, death means nothing compared to an eternity of joy and spiritual enlightenment.**A single day of my life lived as a believer is worth more than a 1000 years of life lived as an unbeliever.**For, thanks to Akbaa, I have seen things which have made me understand the fundamental workings of our universe. Things which will be eternally out of reach of non-believers."
"description_book_iserbius","Iserbius's personal diary."
"book_iserbius_content","It is important for me to leave the story of my life in these pages, for if something happens to me, it will help my successor to serve the Order's cause well.**I have decided to devote my entire life to my beloved Akbaa. From the moment I learned of his existence until I draw my final breath, I will worship him.***Akbaa has given me what no man could ever dream of.**I still remember the blessed day I met Lord Long.*It was in the year 240.**Immediately we met each other's eyes, a powerful affinity between us became apparent. He was like a second father to me, and I am sure that for him, I was the son he never had.*Some time after, when I made my first real entrance to the cult, he made it known to me that I should be his successor.**When I was still a novice, he told me everything about the cult and about Akbaa himself.*He told me that the ultimate goal of the cult was to invoke Akbaa into our dimension, that he had laid the foundations to make this invocation ritual happen, but that, unfortunately, he would not live to see the day of its completion.**Thanks to his powerful clairvoyance, he had already seen the hour of his death.*He begged me to continue the preparations needed to fulfill Akbaa's grand design.**When he died the following year, just as he had predicted, his prophetic words resounded in my mind and, when I had only just been accepted as a full member of the cult, I was made its High Priest. This day marked my greatest grief and my greatest joy. The immeasurable grief of losing my mentor and father, and the unspeakable joy of knowing that our Lord's coming was imminent.**A long period of research started for me then.**I became closer and closer to Akbaa; as close as a mere mortal can be to a god. I saw what cannot be seen, heard things that made no sound and felt things that no man could ever hope to feel. Akbaa gave me more and more power, some physical power, of course, but also a great mastery of the magic arts.**Akbaa is more than a god to me, he is my sun, my air and my nourishment; he is everything to me. Thanks to his supernatural inspiration, I took the reins of his cult with an iron hand.**I began by purging the cult of members that no longer served a useful purpose. Unsatisfactory results now proved as dangerous to these individuals as their shoddiness was to ourselves.*After this essential task had been complete, I had time to plan every aspect of Akbaa's arrival, right down to the finest detail. It was essential that our Order remain completely covert until it was too late to do anything to stop us.**This is when I learned that Falan Orbiplanax had guessed my true purpose and had desired to oppose Akbaa's coming with the help of the Noden.*To stop the Noden from getting involved, I made some important decisions: first, I sent an assassin to kill Orbiplanax, who had become too great a danger.**Second, I brought forward the date of Akbaa's coming. However, we did not have everything in place to invoke him, therefore I ordered that we step up the frequency of sacrificing non-believers by rounding them up in large numbers.*Women and even children would do, I had no time to discriminate...*Further, I stepped up the intensity of our prayers, encouraging more and more members of the cult to give themselves in sacrifice so that Akbaa would finally hear our prayers.**Day after day, I marvelled at the sum of knowledge and power that Akbaa made available to me. To my amazement, Akbaa promised to give me even more upon his arrival, and that he would leave the destiny of Arx in my hands."

"description_book_weapon","The Theory of the Ultimate Weapon, by Kartok."
"book_weapon_content","I have traveled far and wide throughout many lands in search of the ultimate weapon.*I spent much of my youth striving towards this goal but my energies were wasted until one day I realized that all my efforts were in vain.*In vain, because the only way to find the ultimate weapon is to create it.**To make such a weapon, you must seek out the finest metal, forged in the finest forge, then magically enhanced with the finest spell there is.*It is very important to select the finest metal, not only because it determines the keenness of the blade and its strength, but because it must also be capable of receiving and therefore storing a large amount of magical energy.**Additionally, the weight of the metal will determine the maneuverability of the weapon and the efficiency of its thrust and penetration.**Most people use iron to forge their weapons, because iron is the most readily available metal.*But the finest metal known to us today (and in my mind the only one to use if one is to create the ultimate weapon) is mithril, the hardest and most resistant metal ever discovered. It can also produce the finest alloy if it is mixed with another element.**However, the element you mix must be chosen with care, and only the rarest materials, which carry an intrinsic magical value within their very essence, must be used.*Unfortunately, mithril (which is a vital component) is almost impossible to find. Nevertheless, if it was possible to locate a piece of this fantastic metal, the next step is to take it to the very best blacksmith and ask him to forge the weapon.*I will not enter into lengthy philosophical debates, but will give you my clear opinion: to my mind, the finest blacksmiths in the world are dwarves.**Their whole tradition is based on working stone and metal and they have mastered their art to such a degree that even the tools they use to perform their craft are far and away superior to those of any other race. They are the only ones capable of creating in their forges the sharpest and most lethal weapons in existence.**The forge is an important stage, for, the moment it is complete, the weapon must be able to absorb the first magic spell cast on it, and conserve this spell within it for all eternity.**Indeed, the final stage is the enchantment of the weapon.**Many things can magically improve a weapon - the key is in choosing the element the weapon should bind with at the moment of its enchantment.*Let me give you some of the best known enchantments.*The quality of the weapon, however, ultimately depends more on the metal chosen and the forge used than on the element it is combined with...*Here are a few examples, but note that once a weapon has an enchantment, you can't change it:**-Garlic confers a greater ease of handling of the weapon.*-Powdered bone adds some power to the weapon, even more effective if the bones come from a dragon.*-The rock of Amikar gives amazing resistance to a weapon. Once enchanted, the blade seems indestructible.*-A dragon's egg allows the weapon to damage the element it is made of, for example, an enchanted iron weapon will do more damage to iron objects."
"description_book_noden","The Rules of the Noden, the Dimension of the Gods, by the thinker, Aran Salar, archives (Volume 1)."
"book_noden_content","The Noden, kingdom of the gods, exists in a dimension far, far away from our own.*However, from time to time, a bridge is built between this dimension and ours, allowing passage between them. This can happen due to favourable astral convergences such as eclipses or large natural cataclysms like tidal waves.**The dimension that is the Noden works like this: an ambient residual energy exists there, which comes from all directions in the known universe and is attracted towards the Noden.*This energy represents the power of the collective unconscious of the thinking people living in these dimensions. It contains the desires, fears and more generally all the beliefs of these beings.**Thus, each time a being believes in a god, giving them a name, a crystallization of this entity forms on the Noden.*In the beginning, this new-born god is very weak and totally defenceless, but the more believers begin to worship him, the more his energy will grow on the Noden.**Such gods are often prayed to by their followers for something very specific. According to their will and the power they have amassed, they can reward their worshippers with material power and various other powers, which in turn reinforces the faith the followers have in them.**However, if nobody believes in a given god, the latter's energy will begin to decline and will be reduced, in the final stages, to a tiny ectoplasm form, a fragile shadow of their former glory.**It is worthy of note that Krahoz and Zohark both have pride of place at the heart of the Noden, thanks to the adoration they continue to inspire among us.**The Noden also has an 'administrative' body which manages the residences attributed to different gods on the Noden according to the number of followers they have, makes sure that gods are not overstepping the mark, and archives beliefs drained from other dimensions.*This organization itself is also made up of a hierarchy and at the pinnacle of this are the Sybartas race, the thinkers.**Sylib Nurath, who deals with interferences between the Noden and other dimensions, is one of them.**Another race, the Volks, exist there also. They could be called the servants of the Sybartas. They usually only get to perform repetitive and minor tasks."

"book_noden_content_v2","The laws of the Noden are implacable and no one (not even the gods) may break them.**The first and most important rule, is that no god or demon prince shall ever leave the Noden, (Article 1, Chapter 1) the consequences of a god or demon prince in any old dimension would be extremely detrimental to the harmony of the universe.*A god who managed to do this would gain infinite power and could act on all levels of reality and dimension.**This is why gods and demon princes must only interact in dimensions where they are worshiped by signs, dreams or by endowing humans upon whom they confer, different powers. However, they must not, in no shape or form, pass to that dimension.**The few gods who have dared risk an excursion into other dimensions, now rot within enormous crystals called the 'Gems of the Noden', trapped by the Guardians Sylib Nurath sent to bring them back.*The Guardians are, in effect, superior beings created by the Sybartas and sent by the Noden to bridge dimensions for them.*They are not gods, rather the 'police of the gods' who have been entrusted to ensure that the rules of the Noden are respected in all other dimensions.**In the beginning, the Sybartas used to give them great powers so they could bring back the errant gods more quickly, but as soon as they realized the damage that their wealth of powers could cause, they agreed only to empower them with just enough to complete their mission.**However, they were gifted with an outstanding capacity to adapt to new situations and with great speed of learning, allowing them to make better use of whatever resources they may have at their disposal.*By limiting the power Guardians posses, attempts at deification have been avoided.**No mortal can exist in the Noden and any god who wishes to bridge dimensions requires a host body.*In general, such gods use the body of the mortal that has invoked their coming, the latter often being overjoyed to offer themselves in sacrifice.**The Noden keeps a record of all gods who exist, or have ever existed.*Legends in other dimensions therefore tell of Akbaa, Ftaghn-Nayak, Zeus, Zlardos the Vile, Thrn-Glrn, Alador and many others..."

"book_war_magic_content","At the time when humans lived above ground, magic was taught in magic schools, which taught pupils the different possible methods of practising their art.**Some of them used elemental magic, others illusions and, in rare occasions and highly specialized areas, even the odd necromant was allowed to practise.**Magical styles varied enormously, each carrying with it its own philosophy, beliefs and taboos.*Inevitably, these philosophies clashed with each other and certain magi tried to impose their way of seeing things onto other practitioners of magic.**This gave way to a terrifying war.**In fact, no one method was truly stronger than another, so each battle was very equally matched.*As the confrontations went on, each faction began to rely on a single spell to defeat its opponents. The spell to drain all the mana from the opponent was in effect the ultimate spell, as it left the drained adversary incapable of conjuring even the weakest spell against you...**The magi were in a stalemate, with battles reduced to a swift confrontation between two people casting a spell to drain each other's mana.**It was at this point that the Sisters of Edurneum helped the royal college of magic by providing them with a powerful magical object.**This object was made up of two elements which, once joined, allowed a wizard to conserve all his magical energy, even if someone was trying to drain him.**These two elements were named Krahoz and Zohark in memory of two ancient gods.**As soon as this object was used, the conflict ceased, all the opponents agreeing that the person in possession of this artifact was the most powerful.*Krahoz and Zohark were then given to the king of Arx and since that time, have been passed down to his descendents."

"book_day_content","These facts are related by Lord Long, creator and high priest of the Dark Order, in the year 199.***********When he came, I was a brilliant ambassador serving the kingdom of Arx.*At that time, we still lived on the surface where the sun shone with all its might.**On the 37th day of the year 216, I was in the observatory when there was a solar eclipse and I saw a meteorite falling from the sky, heading towards our region.*When it hit the ground, there was a terrible earthquake. I immediately thought it was the end of the world, but as things calmed down, I went to see the point of impact.**The moment my fingers touched this extraterrestrial rock, a vision struck me and knocked me unconscious.*While I was lying unconscious, something began to speak to me.*The voice explained to me that it was here to save our world and that it would show me the path to enlightenment.**I felt enormous hands seize me and I heard murmurs addressed to me in a deep and guttural voice. Then, I saw many images, from the beginning of time to the present. I learned his name, the name of my god: Akbaa, undisputed lord of Arx.**At that moment, I knew what my mission in life was to help Akbaa find followers who believed in his power.*The more followers I could find, the greater the power of my God would be. He would then be able to reincarnate himself on Arx and make me master of the world.**So I built a temple in his honor in the underground tunnels not far from our town to honor him and spread the word of his religion. I also had to make the Koltk meteorite the focus of all our energies.**The only way to satisfy my god was to sacrifice thinking beings to him. The adoration and love I bore him were rewarded with numerous powers and with knowledge of magic spells, making me much more powerful than a mere human.*Power which struck fear into hundreds of non-believers..."
"description_book_chicken","The Power of Chickens, by Lord Inut, the farmer of Liukalau"
"book_chicken_content","I have devoted my whole life to the study of this amazing animal: the chicken.**It is hard to believe that horrible wizards shamelessly use these marvelous creatures so often to perform their evil rituals, sacrificing them for their magic.*I am convinced that chickens are endowed with a great deal of intuition and humor.**The chicken race is made up of 57 different species, each one more amazing than the next and each with its own culture and way of living.**I spent 8 years, day and night, in contact with chickens to try and understand them. I even learned to walk like them to show my respect for them.**After a great deal of concentration, I succeeded in transforming myself into a chicken. You could say, then, that I am a kind of 'were-chicken', turning into a chicken when the moon is favorable.*This new skill, understandably, had a wonderful effect on my studies. I was able to live with chickens, eat with them, feel what they feel, dance with them and even talk to them...**Their language is, in fact, very complex. I will give you a few examples of translation from chicken to human:**Bok means hello;*Brok?! Means what are you doing?;*BokBok! Indicates that what one is about to do is forbidden. *Baaawwwwk shows a marked interest in something.**I could go into more detail with my translations to show you all the nuances of the chickens' clucking, but I think that a simple example should be enough for the intelligence of a normal human being.**What I found out about the intelligence of chickens is just how pronounced their sense of altruism is. *In a chicken community, the dominant male goes out into nearby areas to look for food if none is to be found. As soon as he has found some, he puts a single foot on it and lets rip with a great 'Braaawwwk' which calls the rest of the community to come and feed.*He observes them with a loving eye, and only eats once all others have had their fill.**As part of my experimentation, I have been trying to lay an egg for years now, as yet without success...*A recent study suggested to me that perhaps this was due to my being male, but I cannot subscribe to such a simplistic explanation.*This is why I live in hope to this day..."

"book_history_arx_content","In ancient times, five human tribes inhabited the largest continent in our world.*These tribes were always at war, and the more structured they became, the worse it got.*After years of war and a build-up of hatred, a man by the name of Poxsellis came and succeeded in uniting these different groups.*He became the first king of the humans.**After the last Battle of the Shattered Shields, in the year 170, Arx enjoyed its longest ever period of peace and prosperity.**During Poxsellis' reign, the only period of war was in fact the philosophical wars of the conflict we call 'the War of the Magi'.*However, even though this war was brutal and many people died in it, in fact, it only lasted a few months and had no effect on the political leadership of our kingdom.**For the rest of his reign, Poxsellis was faced by a number of threats.*A large number of goblin invasions were warded off, as rat-men began to live in the city's sewers.**Battles were bloody and this unjust war lasted a long time, but the kingdom's armies, led by Poxsellis himself, massacred their enemies.*And once more, peace reigned over Arx.**The exploration of the oceans began.**Many strong boats put out to sea on the oceans to seek new lands and new treasures.*But in 216, a meteor fell to earth in our world. At first, nobody thought anything of this phenomenon, but certain visionaries sensed that it was a very bad omen for Arx's future.**In fact, just years later, our sun began to die. Light became rarer and rarer and the temperature plummeted to dangerous levels.*Our then very youthful king, Lunshire, son of Poxsellis, ordered that the whole city move to a nearby disused dwarf mine.**It was an enormous amount of work, but all people knew they were working for their own salvation, and not a soul complained.**A peace treaty was signed with all the other races, except the rat-men, with whom it is impossible to talk.*However, their attacks became fewer at this time.**All were busy saving Arx, saving their own lives.*A treaty was signed giving a level of the mine to each race in exchange for the work done.**This harmony lasted five years, during which time our sun perished. Everything was done to save Arx's inhabitants, but nevertheless, many lost their lives.**In addition, nothing was heard from any of the other cities on the continent, and the logical conclusion was reached that they had done the same.**It was not until much later that news arrived, born by members of the Guild of Travellers.**Other fortresses did still exist, spread across the continent, imprisoned in a thick shell of ice.**The Guild of Travellers is now the only thing that allows communication, and the occasional traffic of luxury products, to flow between them.*Apart from these sporadic contacts, Arx is totally self-sufficient."
"description_book_ancient_gods","The Ancient Gods, by Abdul Al Raïf."
"book_ancient_gods_content","In the beginning, the gods were omnipotent. They reigned over Arx for eons before humans made their first appearance.**We know very little about the gods, apart from the fact that it seems they were full of wrath at the proliferation of humans and disappeared from the surface of the earth.**Some very ancient writings suggest that this disappearance was caused by the lack of faith the first mortals showed in them.*Two gods stayed longer than all the others before disappearing. Their names were Zohark and Krahoz.**Zohark was the most powerful of all the gods; he was thunder, lightning and earthquakes. He was storms, hurricanes and everything that represented the brutal force of nature.*But, his power was only liberated by Krahoz.**Krahoz was the goddess of equity, guardian of equilibrium and equality.*They both needed each other, which could be why they stayed longer than the other gods, but finally, they disappeared like the rest.*Modern times saw ancient beliefs abandoned, and humans, who could create magic themselves, had their turn at controlling the earth and the lightning.**Humans entered into a new conceptual era where they had more belief in their own capabilities and only turned to the gods for marginal things such as fertility or hedonism.*They revered the gods of negotiation, gold and luck and even the gods of the poor, but these first gods - the  gods of the brutal forces of creation - had no place in the pantheon.**Since the start of this new era and this shift of faith, the most powerful gods have retreated to their own dimension called the Noden where they await new worshippers to enable them to return."

He was the first to bring together the five human tribes living on our continent in the year 170.**These tribes had been constantly in conflict with each other since the beginning, but not one of them was powerful enough to establish supremacy over the others.*Poxsellis was good and courageous and he challenged and defeated the leader of each of the tribes in what came to be know as the Battle of the Shattered Shields.**For before challenging the tribal leaders, Poxsellis had ventured into an abandoned temple in the Wailing Mine Mountains. From this temple, he brought back an enchanted shield which allowed him to defeat all the leaders.**As soon as he became leader of all five tribes, Poxsellis declared himself King of Arx. After this, he reigned over the new kingdom of Arx with wisdom, fairness and generosity.**He had a long and prosperous reign, despite skirmishes with goblins and rat-men which, thanks to his military genius, he always managed to curb.**He was less fortunate with his descendents.*His first two sons, Elois and Nickus, both fine warriors, died during Poxsellis' lifetime.**Luckily, at the time of his death in 212, his youngest son, Lunshire, was left to succeed him, but he was still too young.*Lord Poncet acted as regent until the boy's coming of age, but he plotted to stop Lunshire from taking the throne. He was never very popular and his little scheme failed, as Lunshire took the throne in 215, at the age of 16.**King Lunshire faced a difficult task from the start, as the sun began its decline over our world.*He was the instigator of the migration of the population underground. He did everything within his power to save as many people as the dwarf mines could take.**He had the diplomatic intelligence to sign a treaty with all the other races in Arx, without which the move would have taken much longer, and may even have been halted by the ice age which was fast approaching.**King Lunshire honored the memory of his father by transporting his coffin to a new crypt, built on the foundation of the miner's tomb, so that people would never lose respect or forget this great king."

Everyone can remember the gigantic balloons kept aloft by hot air which gave us such great capacity for exploration in the past.*They also provided an excellent surveillance system against invasions, allowing us to keep watch over great distances.**Another of the most fabulous inventions ever conceived, was the submarine.**This marvelous construction brought us a new means for fighting off pirates and goblin fleets. This gave us naval supremacy during the dark years of chaos and dispair.**Lord Marko, creator of this priceless invention, is one of the most celebrated heroes in the whole of Arx. But, the greatest human invention is undoubtedly the underground kingdom of Arx.*Perhaps it is not so much an invention as the conversion of an existing structure. Its origins are that of an old dwarf mine with a particularly effective ventilation system.**Already a splendid structure, it has became even more impressive thanks to the way humans have organized it...*The old mine became a truly autonomous world, using all available space. Each known race was granted a level, in accordance with the treaty signed in the year 217. This kingdom is a living demonstration of what human determination can achieve."

"book_race_arx_content","Relations between the different races in Arx have always been difficult.**The goblins were the most populous of all the races, due in part to their high fertility rates. However, as they were never able to organize themselves into a united kingdom, they gradually lost their predominant position.*Fundamentally, goblins are not very intelligent. They have their own language, and mostly speak a kind of pidgin version of human language. They are always looking for something to find fault with, constantly annoying the person they are talking to.*They are liars, arrogant, cowardly and are extremely lazy.*The only time the goblins were the allies of humans was during the time of the great treaty. During this time they helped build the underground kingdom, putting their natural aggression and bad manners aside for a while. However, after the work was complete and they had settled in, they slipped back into their old ways.*It seems that trading gemstones is the only peaceful activity even the most tolerant of each race can bear.**Trolls are a different kettle of fish.*Even if it seems that their origins are similar to those of the goblins, they are completely different. They are very weak-willed and are creatures that seem to live in slow motion.*They are not aggressive, and are much more often benevolent. But their monstrous strength and legendary stamina make them both weighty allies and lethal adversaries.*Their existence is made up of the simple things in life, such as finding something to eat, or somewhere to sleep. Because they are mentally weak, they are quite easy to fool, but woe become anyone who does so if they find out, as their anger is legendary.**The rat-men have always preferred to have very little contact with other races.*They communicate in signs rather than in words, sometimes adding in cooing sounds.*Rat-men are extremely agile, and thus are formidable adversaries in combat. Some of them are the biggest killers in Arx. They are very subtle and extremely swift. They often use poisoned weapons.*They lived underground in the city's sewers when humans still lived aboveground. Feeding off waste products and excrement seems to suit them very well.*Until now, the few run-ins we have had with the rat-men have been brief but bloody. They made occasional forays into human cities to rifle through garbage bins looking for food and rudimentary tools. Since they have been hidden underground in the fortress of Arx, they have slowly lost all contact with all the other races and move around with exemplary discretion.**Dwarves have a passion for anything mechanical, for craftsmanship and for anything to do with engineering; they are also the best blacksmiths in the world. They haved lived in the underground fortress well before all the other races took residence there also.*They are the only ones who know how to build mines and exploit them properly, and they often sell the products they mine to humans.*They have always had an appalling relationship with goblins and wage numerous wars upon them, trying to  eliminate them completely.*One of their largest mines was chosen as a refuge and the site of the new city of Arx. They also helped to build the basic infrastructures on site and undertook many jobs there (apart from those on the goblin level). As they were already used to living in the depths, they moved further underground and continued to exploit their mines.**The origin of the Sisters of Edurneum is a mystery.*They look like hybrids between women and snakes. Their skin is covered in scales.*There seem to be no males in their race and we know nothing about how they reproduce.*They are very gifted in the use of magic, making them the best magicians in Arx. According to certain legend, they were involved in the very origins of magic. They have always been very close to the human race, helping them at every difficult stage of their development.*During their migration, the Sisters promised to help the king of the humans, and created underground plants to feed the inhabitants and their livestock.**Very little is known about dragons. However, scholars have noticed that there are 4815 scales on every specimen studied."

"dragon_not_how","That is part of the worth of all things, Guardian..."
"player_yes_know","Yes... I think I have read it in a tome somewhere..."
"dragon_leave_egg_misc 1","Do not stand too close to my eggs: they do not like the heat..."
"dragon_leave_egg_misc 2","Do not try and use this insane project to steal one of my eggs, will you? You would not be so foolhardy, hmmm?"
"dragon_leave_egg_misc 3","If you so much as touch one of my eggs, I will tear you limb from limb on the spot!"
"dragon_gold_misc 1","So, have you brought my gold?"
"dragon_gold_misc 2","What are you doing, Guardian? Counting my scales? Don't you think there might be other ways of finding out how many scales a dragon has? Don't you know how to read?"
"dragon_gold_right","This sum is correct, Guardian... Take this egg and may the wisdom of dragons guide your sword..."
"dragon_gold_wrong 1","Wrong... I have more scales than that."
"dragon_gold_wrong 2","This sum is too small, almost insulting..."
"dragon_gold_wrong 3","Do I look like I have so few scales?!"
"dragon_leave_place_again_misc 1","Aren't you cold?..."
"dragon_leave_place_again_misc 2","Do you not suffer greatly in this icy chamber?"
"dragon_leave_place_again_misc 3","I think it would be better if you left, the cold must be unbearable for you"
"dragon_explain_guardian","Well, Guardian, are you not chilled to your very core?"
"dragon_explain_guardian2","I know who you are, and do not be surprised, for I could sense it the first time we met. You must discover your identity of your own accord..."
"player_miserabilis","Why did you treat me as a simple human then?"
"dragon_explain_guardian3","Ha ha... traditions have to be kept up..."
"dragon_explain_guardian4","It's been so long since I saw one of the Noden's envoys! I am glad you didn't have too much trouble getting your memory back... To be a Guardian has its advantages, but sometimes it also has its inconveniences..."
"player_question_dragon","In what way?"
"dragon_explain_guardian5","Well, it seems that a Guardian develops a sort of foresight, an ability to move around in time which allows them a new vision of critical situations which would otherwise lead them to a dead end, or into defeat. You must have been able to sense that, even if you were perhaps unaware of it. In fact, know this: you are fated to succeed. Do not hesitate to make use of this skill, as it will be of great service to you..."
"player_question_dragon2","Do I have other powers I am not yet aware of?"
"dragon_explain_guardian6","I think not. It's been a long time since the leaders of the Noden gave great powers to their Guardians... sometimes the cure is worse than the disease... Which brings me to your main weakness: as one of the Noden's creatures, you look like a human and are not native to this dimension. You are free to do most things, but not everything - your ignorance of this dimension, in addition to the things the Noden instilled in you, which you probably have no memory of, will often make you lose your way: perhaps certain conversations you will have will not happen as you expected, the words that come out of your mouth will not be those you would have chosen or even that you would have wanted to say. Do not be concerned, Guardian. You will always be a stranger in Arx, far from human considerations."
"player_dragon6","I must find the entrance to the temple..."
"dragon_scenar6","Well well, held back by a mere door?... Whatever happened to the Guardians of yesteryear?... Do not tarry too long here, I am afraid you will catch cold..."
"player_dragon8","I was unable to destroy the meteor by merely touching it..."
"dragon_scenar8","Things are not always as simple as you think... You are up against a god, Guardian, a mighty adversary! You need in your possession an object with magical powers of protection... I think I remember that just such an object was in the hands of the humans a while ago..."
"player_dragon12","The Ylsides have taken all the humans in the kingdom prisoner..."
"dragon_scenar12","From the little I know of the Ylsides, you'd be better off not taking them on face to face, my friend... Try to be cunning - it is hard to fight what you cannot see.."
"player_dragon14","I seek the secret hideout of Akbaa's followers..."
"dragon_scenar14","You still haven't tried everything... It's time for the final confrontation, my friend, where the destiny of a member of the Noden takes advantage over the other. You must gather your courage and your determination, show all your knowledge of the enemy and strike him down..."
"player_dragon_ghost","The ghost of a woman asked me to avenge her death..."
"dragon_scenar15","Ghosts are tortured souls which were unable to rest after death. Often, finding the person that killed them and throwing light on the circumstances is enough to bring them peace..."

"tizzy_greetings1","Pleased to meet you, handsome.  I'm Tizzy, the owner of this fine establishment, and though I'm acquainted with most of the rogues and scoundrels here in Arx, I don't remember seeing you around - are you from the Travellers' Guild?  But I forget myself, what can I do for you?"
"player_tizzy_greetings2","Nothing in particular right now... How much for a drink?"
"tizzy_greetings2","Just two gold for our finest, sweetheart."
"tizzy_friendly_misc 1","Hmmmm, you know handsome, I wouldn't mind helping you relax - but I really prefer men with a bigger... purse."
"tizzy_friendly_misc 2","2 gold pieces for a drink..."
"tizzy_friendly_misc 3","Did you know that this place dates back to when there was still a sun in the sky and we lived aboveground?  But it was called the Yellow Rose, then - funny, isn't it?"

"player_want_healer","Are you in need of a healer?"
"maria_not_ill","No, no, I'm not sick, It's my little girl, Shany.  She's been missing since yesterday and I'm beside myself with worry."
"player_vanished","Missing?"
"maria_was_playing","She was playing at the other side of the square, near the jeweler's, and she never came back to the stall. Nobody has seen her and the guards are far too busy dealing with the Ylside attacks to do anything about it..."

"shany_greetings","Hello, strange man, I'm Shany.  Have you come to take me back?  Ma and the guards are always telling me to stay out of here because things from the deeper levels can get in through the crypt, but I like playing with the stone heroes..."
"player_shany_about_crypt","Tell me about the crypt, Shany"
"shany_tells_about_crypt","Well, don't tell anyone, but one day, when the door wasn't shut properly, I went all the way down four levels!  It was really scary!  Ok, I have to go now! See you later."

"alicia_why_work","Work? Like a commoner?  Perish the thought.  Why should I work when Gary is so fabulously rich?"
"alicia_love_gary_misc 1","Gary is a rich and influential man... Oh, how I love him!..."

"miguel_buy_misc 2","You can have faith in the quality of all my weapons, I supply the troops of King Lundshire himself!"
"miguel_buy_misc 3","Let me tell you, I've seen many a young tough beguiled by some pretty fretwork or flashy inlay, but my advice is to choose a weapon that best fits your combat style."
"miguel_buy_misc 4","I'll admit, the war with the Ylsides has brought me a fair bit of work, but I've still plenty of stock for the free-lancers.  Help yourself though, I'm busy."
"miguel_buy_misc 5","How are you, my friend, good? Good!  Well have a look around and tell me if something catches your eye."
"player_about_dwarf","I wish to find a dwarf blacksmith..."
"miguel_about_dwarf","Hmmm... a dwarven smith, eh?  Well, to be honest, we haven't seen any of those folk for a long time now.  When the sun died and everyone took shelter in this old mine of theirs, they retreated even deeper into the earth."
"miguel_you_aware","Aha!  So, my friend, I see that you realize there is more than meets the eye here in my little shop!"
"miguel_use_this_trap_misc 1","You'll find the fight pit on the other side of that trap door, good luck."

"player_accuse_erzog","Erzog, I presume... Tell me why you killed Falan Orbiplanax. Are you the high priest of the Cult of Akbaa?"
"erzog_not_high_priest","Oh mercy! Don't kill me! Oh, Guardian of the Light, I am no priest, I swear it! The rituals were only to bring my dear wife back from the dead..."
"player_tell_more","Tell me more, Erzog..."
"erzog_was_contacted","They contacted me, but always remained hidden in shadow.  The priests assured me that if I prayed to Akbaa and performed the rituals, my wife would return to me. But it was all lies! Oh, please have mercy on my wretched soul."
"player_good_reason","Give me another good reason to spare your life, mortal..."
"erzog_give_password","I can help you! The entrance to their temple is through metal door in the Yellow Tulip... they gave me the password - 'Faat Kaa Pell'."
"erzog_forgive_misc 1","Have mercy on me, kind Guardian, I had no idea..."
"erzog_forgive_misc 2","I swear to you on my wife's grave that I will repay my treachery by doing whatever I can to help rid Arx of that blasted cult."

"gary_my_name_misc 1","Welcome, welcome.. My name is Gary and this is my bank.  Here you can change your gold bars and gold nuggets for coin of the realm at a very reasonable rate.. And you can buy shares, too.  You can trust me because I'm the wealthiest and most influential man in town, next to the King, of course.  Ask anyone..."
"gary_my_name_misc 2","Sir, let me tell you that many people have tried to rob me, but I have here the very best locks, wards and protections.  That's in addition to the painfully well-paid guards.  Might as well try to raid the King's coffers."
"gary_my_name_misc 3","Ahhh,... apply yourself lad, and someday you could be almost as rich as I am. But for now, have a look through my merchandise and let me know if there's anything you need."
"gary_bank_stollen_misc 1","Impossible!  I've been robbed!  Ruined! I'll go straight to the King... he's sure to put the captain of the guard on it at once."
"gary_bank_stollen_misc 2","If the guards don't find the guys who robbed me and hang them from the rafters, I'll do it myself."
"gary_bank_stollen_misc 3","Oh lord, I'm ruined.  Well, at least I have the love of my dear Alicia, she would never leave me..."
"tafiok_my_name","Greetings, stranger, I am Tafiok the jeweler.  Please feel free to browse my wares.  If something interests you, pick it up, if you have something to sell, drop it in the chest and I'll make you an offer."
"tafiok_bad_days","Welcome, stranger, I am Tafiok, the jeweler. I fear I must apolgize for my meager stock, but the trolls' strike has cut off my supply completely."
"player_another_way","Is there no other place you can get your gems?"
"tafiok_no_goblins","No, no... The goblins are the only suppliers.  -  But If you can find uncut gems for me, I'll make it worth your while."
"tafiok_still_strike_misc 1","Those trolls will be the death of me if this strike continues much longer.."
"tafiok_still_strike_misc 2","This troll strike is driving me crazy! If only someone could get me some gems!"
"tafiok_still_strike_misc 3","Demand is high, the Travellers' Guild is offering attractive sums and I don't have any gems. Blasted strike!"
"tafiok_thanks","Thank you very much, my good sir. I can offer you a handsome price for those gems."
"5000_leave_me_misc 1","Leave me alone or I'll call the guards."
"5000_leave_me_misc 2","Go away or I'll call the guards."

"Kultar_Hey","Hey!!"
"Kultar_introduction","Stranger, we have to get out of here!"
"player_kultar_wait","I... my memory...it's gone... I remember nothing! Not even my own name! What did I come here to do?"
"kultar_explain","The gobblers probably crept up on you from behind! Bloody gobblers!"
"Kultar_find_something","Come on, look around your cell - there has to be a way to get out on your side... I can't do anything on my side..."
"Kultar_lookwell 1","Go on, have a really good look - I'm sure there's a way to get out of here!"
"Kultar_lookwell 2","There has to be a way out..."
"Kultar_lookwell 3","I'm sure I've heard them whispering about it, and believe me: we have to get out of here, and quick..."
"Kultar_encourage","Hey... Well done!"
"Kultar_encourage2 1","Nice work, stranger.  Now watch out for the goblin!"
"Kultar_encourage2 2","You're on the right track, but watch out for the goblin!"
"Kultar_encourage2 3","We'll be out of here soon!"
"Kultar_killthegob 1","Ha!!"
"Kultar_killthegob 2","Go on, kill him!"
"Kultar_killthegob 3","Aim at his head!"
"Kultar_killthegob 4","Die, you filthy goblin!"
"Kultar_letmeout 1","Brilliant - you got him!! Now, please... open my cell..."
"Kultar_letmeout 2","Will you just open my cell?"
"Kultar_letmeout 3","Work the lever on the side of my cell!"
"Kultar_please","Am Shaegar, Please don't leave me here! Come back!"
"Player_AmShagaar","Am Shaegar?! Is that my name? I cannot remember!"
"Kultar_thanks","Thank you, Am Shaegar... if you can't remember your name, you'd better keep this one... it means ""he who has no name"" in a foreign tongue. My name is Kultar and I was part of the Travellers' Guild before I ended up here..."
"Player_welcome_kultar","Am Shaegar... Yes, I will keep this name for now... What is this Guild of Travellers?"
"Kultar_traveler","Well, you really have lost your memory, haven't you? Our world no longer has a sun to heat it and outside is nothing more than a huge expanse of ice. Only those who are trained and equipped for extreme conditions are allowed to make the dangerous trek between the fortress cities hidden deep in the mountains. These people are the Guild of Travellers..."
"Player_traveler_ok","Right - we will discuss this later - now let's get out of here..."
"Kultar_cantgo","I'm injured. I won't be able to get through this hole. I'll stay here and wait till you can open the door... Don't worry about me..."
"Kultar_door_locked 1","They often lock their own guards in to keep an eye on the prisoners. We have to find another way to get out of here..."
"Kultar_door_locked 2","We can try to break through the trapdoor on the floor. We may be able to find an alternate passage through there."
"Kultar_thanks_again 1","Thanks again. I'll never forget your help, Am Shaegar!"
"Kultar_thanks_again 2","You'd better go now, Am Shaegar"
"Kultar_thanks_again 3","Go, quickly, before the next shift gets here!"
"Kultar_attacks_lord","Die, you bastard!"
"Kultar_victory_goblord","Am Shaegar, we got him!"
"Kultar_explain_lord","Just after you went through the hole, I heard a noise. So I hid and waited till the goblin came in. This time, I got the drop on him, sneaky bastard."
"Kultar_explain_lord_misc 1","I couldn't go and leave you down here..."
"Kultar_explain_lord_misc 2","Aaghh - my wound has opened... I'm going to have to see to it..."
"Kultar_explain_lord_misc 3","I'll stay here, just till I've recovered from this fight. We'll see each other again later..."
"player_kultar_killed_ylside01","Kultar!!"
"kultar_killed_ylside01","It was all a trap to get rid of you, Am Shaegar. As soon as I found out their plan, I knew I couldn't let them do it, my friend..."
"kultar_killed_ylside01bis","Yes... I prefer to kill you myself... I bet you thought I was dead!!"
"player_kultar_killed_ylside02","Thank you. But where is the King?"
"kultar_killed_ylside02","Iserbius doesn't give a shit about the King. If the King is alive, he's in hiding.  He's probably holed up with the rest of his people in the guard room."
"player_kultar_killed_ylside03","I am beginning to understand why the Ylsides did not kill all the humans in the kingdom..."
"kultar_killed_ylside03","That would be madness! Akbaa's hungry, and Iserbius saves some of them as a supply of fresh meat for his master. Akbaa will eat every last one if he gets the chance..."
"player_kultar_killed_ylside04","Kultar, what brought you to work for the Ylsides and Iserbius?"
"kultar_killed_ylside04","When I got out of jail, it seemed like a good idea... Iserbius is very persuasive, you know, and he's got big ideas... He wants to bring the sun back to Arx and get all the humans out of these rat-infested caves... For someone like me, who has been Outside, that sort of plan makes perfect sense..."
"player_kultar_killed_ylside05","So why did you betray him?"
"kultar_killed_ylside07","All the human sacrifices, all the deaths, the blood... And when I heard there was nothing he wanted more than to get rid of you, I couldn't bear it... I knew that I had been wrong until now, and that I had to find you and help you..."
"kultar_killed_ylside05","Here, let me give you this armor."
"kultar_killed_ylside06","Now, get out of here quick - use the sewers. I'll make something up to tell the others..."
"priest_hi 1","Hello, brother."
"priest_hi 2","May Akbaa save us."
"priest_hi 3","May Akbaa be with us"

"priest_justyouwait 3","If he ever comes back, Lord Iserbius will take care of him"
"priest_justyouwait 4","Gone, I guess he had enough"

"priest_misc 3","Aahhhhem."
"priest_misc 4","Chllruuhhhhhh *phlegm-hoik*"
"priest_victory 1","We have to warn Lord Iserbius immediately."
"priest_victory 2","The Lord told us a Guardian would come."

"iguk_yoom","Yomm tar yllza tourr..."

"player_brother_shagar","Yes. My name is Brother... Shaegar. Are you blind?"
"iguk_yes","Yes. It was my personal sacrifice to our great and beloved Akbaa, soon may he reign supreme..."
"player_beloved","Yes, soon..."
"iguk_salvation","Akbaa is our savior. May he be blessed... Through his good work, we will once again live on the Outside. Our children will at last see the sunshine and we will play in the newly-grown grass. It shames the nation that most of them don't believe in Akbaa. I understand that people find the human sacrifices a bit scary, but it is the only way to salvation. Pray with me, Brother Shaegar. You know Akbaa needs our faith..."
"player_find_statue","May I come closer to the meteor? I wish to pray even closer to Akbaa. I have so much to say to him..."
"iguk_dont","Oh, didn't you know? Master Iserbius has activated the security system... Only he and the high priests can get into the meteor room now. Apparently a Guardian has been sent by the Noden to destroy our beloved meteor..."
"player_freaky","What terrible news... Akbaa protect us!"
"iguk_disturb","Yes. Let us return to our prayers, brother."
"dissident_saw_last_fight","Did you see the latest fight yesterday?"
"dissident_how_enter_club","No. I don't know how to get into the arena, is there a secret code?."

"Human_guard_sacred_generic 1","Good day to you."
"Human_guard_sacred_generic 2","Talk to Alia. I'm not supposed to talk to you."
"Human_guard_sacred_generic 3","We are here to protect Alia."

"Human_guard_sacred_generic 5","Don't even try to lay a finger on Alia."
"Human_guard_greetings_sacred_after_shield 1","Greetings."
"Human_guard_greetings_sacred_after_shield 2","You have helped our cause. Thanks for the shield, Am Shaegar."
"Human_guard_greetings_sacred_after_shield 3","Thanks to you, the kingdom will be restored."
"Human_guard_sacred_generic_vb 1","Hey..."
"Human_guard_sacred_generic_vb 2","I bet you're surprised to see people down here."
"Human_guard_sacred_generic_vb 3","We are here to protect Alia."

"Human_guard_greetings_sacred_after_shield_vb 3","The kingdom is safe, thank you."
"Human_guard_sacred_victory 1","Now, let's warn Alia about what's happened."
"Human_guard_sacred_victory 2","AARGH AARGH, now what??"
"Human_guard_sacred_victory 3","This one won't do any harm now."
"Human_guard_sacred_victory 4","That one was good practice."
"Human_guard_sacred_krahoz_protected1","Do you think Krahoz is well enough protected?"
"Human_guard_sacred_krahoz_protected2","Don't worry, it is well guarded. I'd be surprised if anyone managed to steal it."
"Human_guard_sacred_krahoz_stolen1","I'd like to teach a lesson to the thief who has stolen Krahoz myself."
"Human_guard_sacred_krahoz_stolen2","Let me be the one to cut off his hands!"
"redset_greetings","You can call me Redset. I'm in charge of weapons and armor in this camp. I buy and sell them..."
"Alia_misc 1","hmmmm"
"Alia_misc 2","What should I do?"
"Alia_misc 3","Oops!"
"Alia_misc 4","Those snake women are driving the Order mad"

"Alia_misc 8","Ahaa."
"Alia_thanks_altar","Oh, bless you stranger. I don't know who you are, but you've made a friend today."
"player_alia_altar","Akbaa will have to look elsewhere for his meal."
"Alia_thanks_altar_2","I won't forget this, I promise..."
"Alia_lake_greetings","What a pleasure to see you again, stranger."
"player_lake_alia","The sentiment is mutual. I do not even know your name, and I think..."
"Alia_lake_greetings_2","Later... let me be 'the mysterious woman' for now."
"Alia_lake_misc 1","It's a beautiful spot, don't you think?"
"Alia_lake_misc 2","Don't worry, I'm not as out of place here as you may think.  I can take care of myself."
"Alia_lake_misc 3","You'll come back and see me sometime, right?"
"player_alia_looking_for_Krahoz","I seek a magic object that was in the possession of a rebel group so I can apprehend the people that kidnapped you."
"Alia_krahoz_lake","Do you, now?  What do you know about this 'magic object'?"
"player_alia_looking_for_Krahoz_2","They call it Krahoz. It once belonged to the Kingdom of Arx. It must be combined with Zohark to unleash its full potential."
"Alia_krahoz_lake_2","Hmmm... well, perhaps you'd better follow me..."
"Alia_real_introduce_01","Ahh... you're waking up at last. Hello again, Am Shaegar."
"player_alia_real_introduce_01","My head... Where am I? You know my name?"
"Alia_real_introduce_02","You're in the middle of the so-called 'rebel' camp, and you've got their chief right here in front of you..."
"player_alia_real_introduce_02","What? You are the head of the gang that killed the queen, kidnapped the baby and stole Krahoz? "
"Alia_real_introduce_03","You shouldn't believe everything you're told... and anyway, you're not here because of that story, are you?"
"player_alia_real_introduce_03","True enough, I'm here because I need Krahoz to destroy the Cult of Akbaa."
"Alia_real_introduce_04","Well, I tried to investigate the Cult of Akbaa myself, which clearly didn't go so well. As for Krahoz, we've got it here for safekeeping. But I can let you have it, providing you can find me an equally powerful item to replace it."
"player_alia_real_introduce_04","Why should you trust me? I could tell the King of all this..."
"Alia_real_introduce_05","Well, there's this little matter of you saving my life... and as far as I can tell, you are the single greatest enemy of Akbaa's cult at the moment, so we've a common enemy.  But if it comes right down to it, you cross me, you die."
"player_alia_real_introduce_05A","Don't worry, I won't betray you."
"player_alia_real_introduce_05B","Tell me about this object you want in exchange for Krahoz."
"Alia_real_introduce_06","I have found old legends of 'The Shield of Ancients', buried many years ago with a great warrior.  I've sent a number of expeditions to find it, but so far with no success.  Bring me the shield and Krahoz is yours."
"player_alia_real_introduce_06","I will do this thing."
"Alia_real_introduce_misc 1","Do not betray my trust, Am Shaegar."
"Alia_real_introduce_misc 2","A fair trade, Krahorz for the shield."
"Alia_real_introduce_misc 3","You see, we infamous rebels aren't as bad as we're made out to be."
"Alia_player_with_shield_01","My spies tell me that you've found the shield, is this true?"
"Player_Alia_back_with_shield_01","Here it is."
"Alia_player_back_with_shield_02","Oh, Am Shaegar, you have no idea...  You see, this shield is much more than just a magical artifact; it is the shield of my grandfather, King Poxsellis."
"Player_Alia_back_with_shield_02","Grandfather... So you are..."
"Alia_player_back_with_shield_03","Alia, daughter of King Lunshire and Queen Florence, Princess of Arx, at your service."
"Player_Alia_back_with_shield_03","Why do you stay in hiding? How can you stay with these people who kidnapped you and killed your mother?"
"Alia_player_back_with_shield_04A","'These people' are my protectors and bodyguard, the secret order of 'The Sacred Dagger' founded by King Poxsellis himself. Their only mission is to protect the royal bloodline."
"Alia_player_back_with_shield_04B","They did not kill my mother. They found me near her body shortly after my birth. To this day, no one knows who killed her."
"Player_Alia_back_with_news","Her murderer has been identified and he has paid dearly for his actions.."
"Alia_player_back_with_news","Really?  Well you are full of surprises, Am Shaegar.  After so long... it is a relief to know she's been avenged."
"Player_Alia_back_with_shield_04","Why are you still in hiding?"
"Alia_player_back_with_shield_05","Before my birth, The Sacred Dagger discovered that the Snake Women of the Order of Edurneum wanted me dead, though they could not determine why.  They ochestrated my kidnapping in order to preserve the kingdom's legacy. They considered using the Travellers' Guild to take me away from Arx, but the Order has agents everywhere, it seems."
"Player_Alia_back_with_shield_05","Does your father know of any this?"
"Alia_player_back_with_shield_06A","No, no. He's not even aware that I'm still alive!  As far as he knows, the Sacred Dagger is nothing more than a band of dissidents and malcontents. And frankly, I would be happier if it stayed that way - for his own safety... Promise me you will not breathe a word of this to him."
"Alia_player_back_with_shield_06B","I will honor my word, of course, and instruct the guards to let you into the dungeon where we keep Krahorz.  Use it well, stranger."
"alia_player_bring_krahoz","Am Shaegar, you are very kind, but I think this will better serve you in your quest."
"alia_krahoz_stolen","If we get our hands on the sneak thief who stole Krahoz, we'll show him the true meaning of suffering. Will you help us, Am Shaegar? If you help us find the bastard, or if you can find and return Krahoz, I will reward you... personally."
"alia_krahoz_stolen_misc 1","Please bring Krahoz back to us..."
"alia_krahoz_stolen_misc 2","Bring me the thief's head..."
"player_bring_stolen_krahoz","I have found and executed the culprit. Here is Krahoz..."
"alia_stolen_krahoz_thanks","You have proven yourself a capable ally, Am Shaegar.  Here, let us aid your quest with a gift of gold."
"player_bring_stolen_krahoz2","I am only doing what I think is right..."
"player_bring_krahoz-zohark","I think this may be of interest to you."
"alia_bring_krahoz-zohark","Krahoz and Zohark together. This is an object of incredible power! Far more powerful than Krahoz on its own!"
"alia_let_shield","As for the Shield of the Ancients, we no longer need it. Take it as a token of our thanks."
"Alia_thanks_krahoz","Thank you for doing this for us, Am Shaegar... You know, I've come to value your counsel greatly... Please stay here with me a moment..."
"alia_nightmare","Where are you going, Am Shaegar? Are you unhappy with me? I know how important your quest is, but..."
"alia_nightmare2","I'm going to make sure you stay here with me FOR EVER!!"
"alia_nightmare3","Go, Am Shaegar, and please take good care of yourself..."
"alia_revelations_father","Am Shaegar, I've been thinking... perhaps you are right, my father should know I'm alive..."
"player_alia_father","It must be your decision."
"alia_revelations_father_2","Please show him this, my signet ring.  The Sacred Dagger took it as proof of my heritage when they saved me. Tell my father I'll wait for him by the lake..."
"alia_debriefing","Thank you, Am Shaegar.  This is all very confusing, so much has happened so quickly... I've met the father I never knew, discovered that somewhere I have a sister...  It will take time to adjust to it all.  But one thing I'm sure of, I am sincerely grateful for everything you've done for us."
"alia_debriefing_unhappy","Am Shaegar... I'm sure you should be thanked for what you have done.  After the snake women stormed our camp and captured me, I lost all hope. But imprisoned there I heard a voice, at once strange, yet familiar.  It was my mother, whose spirit you freed by finding her killer... she comforted me, then explained to the snake women that I was not the one they sought.  Am Shaegar, rather than thanking you for what you have done, I would rather thank you for what you must do next, save our world from Akbaa."
"sacred_sword_debriefing_unhappy","Am Shaegar... you filthy traitor,  May Akbaa take you!   What could we have possibly done to you to make you want to sell us out to the snake women?  *cough, cough* A curse on you and that damned Order..."
"sacred_sword_debriefing_sad","Am Shaegar... Alia has been taken away by the snake women, they've left this world, nothing can be done for her now... We've tried our best... now go, destroy Akbaa!"
"king_debriefing_happy","Am Shaegar. Once again, you have helped us most wonderfully. Now go and complete your quest: destroy Akbaa once and for all!"
"king_debriefing_unhappy","Please, Am Shaegar, leave me to my grief. Now go and complete your quest: destroy Akbaa once and for all!"

"Human_guard_1st_time 3","I'm not here to give you information. It's my boss, Carlo, you need to see for that sort of thing..."

"Human_guard_generic_vb 2","Hey, mate"
"Human_guard_generic_vb 3","Look, I'm a bit too busy to talk right now"
"Human_guard_generic_vb 4","You should talk to Carlo if you want to apply for a job"

"Human_guard_generic_vc 1","You'd better watch your step, mate"
"Human_guard_generic_vc 2","Look, I have no money for you, just leave me alone, will you."
"Human_guard_generic_vc 3","I'm on duty right now"
"Human_guard_generic_vc 4","Hey, mate!"
"Human_guard_greetings_guardian_vc 1","Save us, Guardian."

"Human_guard_victory 3","This one won't clutter up the prisons..."
"Human_guard_victory 4","That was a good bit of practice..."

"Human_guard_victory 6","Look at you now!"
"Human_guard_guardmode 1","Hey! What's going on?"
"Human_guard_guardmode 2","Something moved over there..."

"Human_guard_guardmode 6","What do we have here?!"
"Human_guard_guardmode 7","Over there! You!"
"Human_guard_back2guard 1","No... Nothing there... I really am going to have to stop drinking..."
"Human_guard_back2guard 2","I could have sworn I heard something, though!"
"Human_guard_back2guard 3","Roll on the end of the shift..."
"Human_guard_back2guard 4","Nothing. Better that way, I suppose..."
"Human_guard_back2guard 5","Oh? Nothing!"
"Human_guard_back2guard 6","I really thought I saw something"
"Human_guard_search 1","Hey, where did he go?"
"Human_guard_search 2","He went that way!"

"Human_guard_bedrooms 2","Can't stay here, sir - it's out of bounds..."
"Human_guard_bedrooms 3","Private property."
"Human_guard_bedrooms 4","I'm asking you to move on - I've got orders to follow!"
"Human_guard_bedrooms_aggressive 1","I'll give you three seconds to get out of here. If you don't, I'll have to attack you..."

"Ortiern_welcome","A civilian?... I am Ortiern, captain of the King's armies and commander of this outpost. Are you a mercenary? Can we count on your help?"
"Player_welcome_ortiern","Mercenary? Perhaps... For now, I have just put some distance between myself and a couple of goblins. What happened to you?..."
"Ortiern_briefing1","We were attacked by a small group of Ylsides; they wounded me and took three of my men..."
"Player_ortiern1","The Ylsides?"
"Ortiern_briefing2","Two hours ago, three of them infiltrated the outpost. They attacked without warning or provocation. The Ylside have earned a reputation as fierce and unstoppable warriors, and now I've seen it with my own eyes.. Their speed is unbelievable,  in a flash they disabled and dragged off three of my men... And you must have seen what they did to Karnok... I don't know why they did that, but I do know it would be long before they return."
"Player_ortiern2","Find someone else to help... I have my own problems to deal with..."
"Ortiern_briefing3","You are my only hope! I cannot trust the rabble at the tavern! I'd sooner trust a total stranger."
"Player_ortiern3","I just told you that..."
"Ortiern_briefing4","You have to go to the castle and tell the King what has happened here! This is of vital importance! Since the last earthquake, the path to the castle has been blocked by a cave-in and we have been unable to get through. You must tell him that the Ylsides have declared war on us!..."
"Player_ortiern4","This is ridiculous! You have just told me that the path leading to the castle is blocked!"
"Ortiern_briefing5","You should be able to go through the goblins' caves, two levels down, and find a way  back up to this level. It's dangerous and roundabout, but we have no choice! If you find a way back up there, you should be back in the human kingdom once again."
"Player_ortiern5","Impossible, I've only just escaped from a goblin prison!"
"Ortiern_briefing6","Here, this will help; it's a gemstone dealer's license. As long as they think you're a salesman and you don't attack them, they will probably leave you alone.  I have to stay here. You are our only hope, brave mercenary!"
"Ortiern_repeat_briefing 1","Have I already told you that you are our only hope?"
"Ortiern_repeat_briefing 2","Do you understand? Right... Go into the goblins' caves with the license I've given you, and find a way back up to the King's castle."
"Ortiern_repeat_briefing 3","Once you have seen the King, he will clear the pathway and send reinforcements to fight the Ylsides..."
"Ortiern_repeat_briefing 4","If you will not do this for me, do it for the kingdom, brave mercenary!"

He says he needs help to clear the pathway to the castle, which is blocked by a landslide. They have also been attacked by a small number of Ylsides and will be unable to resist another attack."
"king_player_1stmeet1","Good heavens!  These are grave tidings, Am Shaegar.  You have done our kingdom a great service, and you have our deepest gratitude.  You will be rewarded commensurate with the risks you've taken to bring us this news.  This cave-in is no small problem, however, and it's solution will take some consideration."
"king_player_1stmeet1bis","I have decided on a course of action.  You will take this message to Pog, king of the trolls.  His people are very capable miners, they even helped construct this village.  The trolls live one level below us, you may have encountered them already... they are just as ugly as goblins, but five times the size.  But relations are excellent between our two kingdoms, just the same.  We've a shared hatred for the rat-men... I am sure they will provide immediate help."
"player_king_1stmeet2","It seems I can't escape being drawn into these events... Well, I will help you, but I expect your help in return."
"king_player_1stmeet2","Do not fear, you will be well rewarded for this task."
"player_king_1stmeet3","Gold will do me little good if I can't regain my memory!"
"king_player_1stmeet3","I'm sure it will all come back to you. The goblins must have given you a serious knock to the head, that's all. Don't worry. And now, I beseech you, take this message as the kingdom's emissary to Pog, king of the trolls..."
"king_player_1stmeet_misc 1","Now, I beg of you, Am Shaegar, go and speak to Pog, the king of the trolls."
"king_player_1stmeet_misc 2","I'm sure your memory will come back, little by little."
"king_player_1stmeet_misc 3","Well, I can see no reason for you to hang around here any longer, eh?"
"king_player_1stmeet_misc 4","Hurry! My men are trapped at the outpost!"
"king_player_rocksaway1","Thank you once more, Am Shaegar. The rocks have been cleared.  You have once again earned our thanks and this reward.  You have proven yourself a valuable asset to the kingdom, and I will have to consider a more official role for you here..."
"king_player_rocksaway2","Ah, yes... how would you like it if I made you a..."
"Carlo_breaks_in1","Your Majesty... We have discovered signs that another ritual has taken place..."
"king_player_rocksaway3","Hmm. That's the third one in less than a week. Where this time?"
"Carlo_breaks_in2","Just by the air duct, Your Majesty. Do you think this could be connected with Falan Orbiplanax murder?"
"king_player_rocksaway4","Probably... I will get my new friend to look into it. Thank you, Carlo, you may go!"
"Carlo_breaks_in3","Very good, Sire."
"king_player_rocksaway5","Well, then... What do you think of this? I suggest you investigate this shady sect, who I am almost sure have executed Falan Orbiplanax, our old astronomer. I need someone that is not known as an agent of the King, a fearless man. Will you serve me in this role?"
"player_king_rocksaway1","This is all somewhat confusing, Your Majesty. But I could certainly look into it..."
"king_player_rocksaway6","I know you will not disappoint me. You will be free to question any of my people in your investigations. Guards, give this man free rein of the castle's private quarters!  In addition, dear Am Shaegar, here is the key to one of the royal chambers, it is now yours. Please consider it your new home."
"player_king_rocksaway2","That is a most kind gesture..."
"king_player_rocksaway7","Don't mention it! We will hold a Council meeting as soon as you bring back news of these disturbing events."
"king_player_rocksaway_misc 1","We will hold a meeting of the Council once you have uncovered some clues."
"king_player_rocksaway_misc 2","I am delighted to be able to count on your assistance, Am Shaegar."
"king_player_rocksaway_misc 3","Do you like your new room?"
"king_player_rocksaway_misc 4","May the gods help you in your investigations."
"king_krahoz","Finally, Krahoz is returned to us. Many thanks for your honesty and devotion, Am Shaegar. Bear it to the Sisters of Edurneum immediately. They will be delighted to get their prized possession back and they will no longer bother me about it... The Kingdom of Arx will never forget your courage."
"player_king_gold","I need a lot of gold to save Arx..."
"king_player_gold","Our kingdom is far from being fabulously wealthy, Am Shaegar, but given all you have done for us and what you intend to do, how could we refuse this modest sum..."
"king_gard_warmeet1","I have been informed of unrest in the lower levels of the city. Alert the guards at the outpost!"
"guard_king_warmeet1","At your command!"
"king_warmeet2","Any news about the Ylsides, my friends?"
"carlo_warmeet1","Our men are holding the fort, Sire."
"felnor_warmeet1","I think we would be wise to locate their hideout before their next attack..."
"chinkashh_warmeet1","If humans were more familiar with magic, it would make things a lot easier..."
"kacel_warmeet1","All these Ylsides are heretics who must be punished!..."
"king_warmeet3","The kingdom cannot suffer such continual threat!"
"king_warmeet4","For twenty years now, a handful of rebels have been making a mockery of my best men. Those days are over, Carlo, do you understand?"
"carlo_warmeet2","But Sire, we have had little actual encounter with these rebels in all this time... Maybe they've become the Ylsides themselves!"
"king_warmeet5","I will hear of no more maybes, Carlo. I want results, do you understand me?"
"king_warmeet6","We need more information about the earthquakes. It's getting more and more troubling."
"felnor_warmeet2","Minor tremors have always been a part of life in Arx, but there's no denying that they've become more frequent of late... I suspect that the energy channel created by Akbaa's worshippers must disturb the natural order... It must stop, and soon..."
"king_warmeet7","Do you think there is a danger of a general collapse?"
"chinkashh_warmeet2","If this were the case, our Order would have discovered it... The real danger at the moment is Akbaa..."
"king_warmeet8","Be vigilant, both of you, and warn me the minute you have news..."
"king_council_come_start","Very well, now that all the members of the Council are present, let us begin! Felnor, what have you found in Falan Orbiplanax's notes?"
"felnor_council_see_note","Let me see... Aaaahhh, Falan mentions something about the guard, Erzog. He says he saw him practising dark rituals involving animal sacrifices. Perhaps it was Erzog who is behind Falan's murder... Or perhaps it was even the high priest of the Cult of Akbaa. Oh, listen to this: 'I have discovered the existence of a cult which wishes to invoke Akbaa onto Arx'"
"king_council_take_erzog","I was always suspicious of that Erzog. GUARDS! Throw Erzog into the cells!"
"player_council_mentioned_akbaa","Felnor, who is this Akbaa I heard you speak of?"
"kacelbem_council_akbaa_demon","Akbaa is a powerful devil, the god of destruction that this cult is evidently trying to invoke and bring back to Arx. It would be blasphemy to allow this act to be perpetrated, and a total disaster for every living being on our planet..."
"felnor_council_contact_noden","Yes, yes, here: listen to the next bit: 'This evening, I will contact the Noden to ask for their help.'"
"King_council_noden","The Noden??"
"felnor_council_yes_noden","The Noden is the dimension which regulates the existence of gods. They maintain the universal equilibrium by preventing an imbalance in the power of gods."
"kacelbem_council_fallan_really","If Falan really had been able to contact the Noden, it is possible they may have sent an emissary here to stop the coming of Akbaa..."
"King_council_gardian","An emissary?"
"felnor_council_gardian","These emissaries are creatures of pure energy when they are on the Noden. They are sent to cut off the energy channels which might drive the gods out of their dimension. I have heard amazing tales of emissaries who have the strength of 100 men, or who can perform the highest forms of magic, others who are invincible. These emissaries are called Guardians..."
"kacelbem_council_cinematic_cult","Somewhere in the fortress is a cult which recites impious prayers to a fragment of a meteorite made entirely of a material called Koltk. This rock is said to come from the place where Akbaa was born... Normally, this substance is indestructible. In truth, Felnor, only a Guardian of the Noden could destroy this meteor..."
"suiberis_council_how_guardian_stop","How could one of these Guardians stop the incarnation of a god just by destroying a piece of rock?"
"kacelbem_council_prayer_heretics","It is the impious prayers of the priests and their hideous sacrifices which are focused by the meteor. It provides a channel of energy for Akbaa who, when he has gathered enough, will be able to complete his incarnation in Arx. If that happens, destruction and suffering will be unleashed upon us.  We must find and destroy this meteorite at any cost."
"player_council_how_find_guardian","How will we find this Guardian?"
"felnor_council_Koltk_sample","I have a fragment of Koltk in my laboratory which may be of great assistance in finding him."
"king_council_here_situation","Let's be clear about one thing: we know that the Cult of Akbaa has a great presence in Arx, and that it is gaining power. Luckily, we were able to stop Erzog, the cult's high priest, before it was too late. But other worshippers could still invoke Akbaa. We must find this famed Guardian of the Noden as soon as possible."
"carlo_council_also_war","In addition, the war with the Ylsides is very troubling, Your Majesty. What should we do about it?"
"king_council_shall_brief","Carlo, we need a solid plan of defence. I fear the worst. Nobody knows exactly what these Ylsides are or who commands them. GUARDS! Bring me the fragment of Koltk!"
"king_council_while_army","Am Shaegar, while our army is facing the Ylsides, we will need your help to find this legendary Guardian... I cannot deny that this task will be harsh and lengthy. In fact, we have no idea what the Guardian will look like or even if he is already among us. But I have faith in your capabilities."
"guard_council_here_sample","Here is the stone, Your Majesty."
"king_council_put_table","Good. Put it on the table."
"king_council_take_sample","Take this stone, Am Shaegar. It is a small thing, but the Guardian is the only one who is capable of destroying this fragment of meteor. Above all, take great care..."
"carlo_council_aaahhh","Aaaahh!"
"king_council_amazing","Great heavens!!"
"chinkashh_council_cant_believe","Ffffffff!!"
"felnor_council_so_am_shagar","But that means that Am Shaegar is..."
"king_council_guardian_well","... The Guardian! It all makes sense to me now, and especially his constant desire to help others! I am honored to meet you, Guardian!"
"player_council_surprise_for_me","Touching this stone has enlightened my mind. I was sent here to stop the coming of Akbaa and I must act without delay. First, I need to gain access to the secret temple, there I will destroy the stone by simply touching it!"
"felnor_council_noden_with_you","May the wisdom of the Noden guide you, Am Shaegar."
"king_council_now_go","Do not let us delay you further."
"suiberis_greetings_player","I am the new astronomer. I was assistant to poor Falan Orbiplanax, and since his death, I do my best to look after the observatory."
"player_observing_misc","What do the stars tell you?"
"suiberis_nothing_stars","Nothing. They sky is yet overcast."
"suiberis_nothing_misc 1","The current astral configuration is fascinating."
"suiberis_nothing_misc 2","My job demands high levels of concentration, you know."
"suiberis_nothing_misc 3","If you would excuse me, I really do have many calculations to check and lots of horoscopes to prepare..."
"player_rituals_suiberis","Suiberis, what can you tell me about the rituals? Do you know who killed Falan Orbiplanax?"
"suiberis_dont_know_rituals","Really, I don't know what you're talking about. You know, I'm still just a novice in my art. And on top of that, I hate violence."
"felnor_greetings","I am Felnor, alchemist of the kingdom and friend of the late Falan Orbiplanax."
"player_felnor_falan","Who was Falan Orbiplanax?"
"felnor_greetings2","Falan was our astronomer. He died a few days ago. I think he was about to bring to light a terrible plan. But he never got time to say more about it..."
"felnor_laboratory_generic 1","Take a look around, while I'm working..."
"felnor_laboratory_generic 2","If you find anything of interest in my laboratory, please don't hesitate to help yourself."
"player_felnor_falan2","I am investigating the rituals and the death of Falan Orbiplanax."
"felnor_falan","All I can tell you is that these two things are linked... I have here a note that Falan gave me the day he died in case anything happened to him. I never really understood what it meant. Maybe you will understand..."
"felnor_keep_looking_weapon","You must make use of this legendary weapon, Guardian..."
"Iserbius_welcome","I know who you are and why you're here! Orbiplanax must have had time to contact the Noden. I should have seen to him sooner. A Guardian! Your presence here is of great encouragement to us. This proves we finally have the power to bring Akbaa to life here and that he is more powerful than ever... As for the two of us, my sweet, we will continue this ceremony later..."
"Iserbius_incantation","In raaa Nikaaa dum Reanima."
"carlo_statue_guard_post_attack","Majesty, our outpost has been attacked by the Ylsides. This time, there were no survivors. What's worse, we have not found the bodies. Perhaps they have been taken..."
"king_statue_damned_where","Great heavens! Where could they have been taken?"
"carlo_statue_dont_know","We do not know. They were swift and merciless. They are a formidable enemy, Sire."
"king_statue_supposed_linked","I suppose these Ylsides are indeed part of the Cult of Akbaa..."
"player_statue_you_mean","Under the orders of Iserbius?"
"king_statue_no_proof","I don't really have any proof, but we first heard of them when the Cult of Akbaa appeared... But there's something else: Suiberis left the kingdom recently. He must have been able to tell that we were about to discover the truth about him..."
"player_statue_what_truth","What truth?"
"felnor_statue_have_figured","Suiberis and Iserbius are one and the same... He is behind Falan's murder..."
"player_statue_why_iserbius","Now I understand why Iserbius was waiting for me at the temple! He knew I was coming!"
"king_statue_so_am_shagar","So you fought with him! Finally, a bit of good news... Am Shaegar, tell me that you have destroyed the source of evil once and for all."
"player_statue_sorry","No. I was unable to destroy the meteor.  Instead I felt my energy draining away... "
"king_statue_damned","Good Lord! How can that be possible? Felnor, how can you explain that?"
"felnor_statue_mhh","Hmmmhh, I was afraid this might happen... The stone is now in resonance with Akbaa and the energy channel drains both your physical and your magical energy to feed Akbaa... In fact, by touching it, you have sent your own power to our worst enemy..."
"king_statue_damned2","But there must be some way of stopping this nevertheless..."
"felnor_statue_mhh2","At the time of the terrible War of the Magi, long, long ago, energy drains were common, and of course, so were wards against them..."
"king_statue_can_guess","I think I understand what you mean, Felnor, but even my very best men have always failed in this quest."
"felnor_statue_not_best_man","Am Shaegar is not one of your best men, Sire, he is a Guardian, sent by the gods..."
"player_statue_apreciate_explanation","If you think there is the slightest chance that I can destroy this meteor, I will find a way to do it..."
"felnor_statue_your_only_chance","You must protect yourself against the meteor's energy drain.  During the War of the Magi, the kingdom was given an artifact of immense power by the Order of Edurneum.  Without it we would quite possibly have lost the war.  This artifact was composed of two pieces, Krahoz and Zohark.  Any magician who possesed both of these items became immune to all energy-draining effects.  It was thanks to this protection that the war was finally won."
"player_statue_where_the_problem","Well, then, just give me this object..."
"felnor_statue_more_complicated","That's where it gets complicated... In fact, when this object was given over to us, a treaty was signed with the Order of Edurneum by Poxsellis, father to our current King. This pact stipulated that we were to return the artifact to the Order when they requested it..."
"player_statue_fair_enough","I see no wrong there. So?"
"king_statue_20_years","So, 20 years later, a group of rebels rose up from god knows where, killed my wife and kidnapped my daughter, who had only just been born!!!"
"felnor_statue_steal_krahoz","And more to the point, they also took Krahoz. Luckily, we prevented them from stealing Zohark. The Order turned up a few hours later and demanded that we return the whole object to them. We could only give them Zohark and ever since, they have been demanding that we honor our pact and find Krahoz once more. We have never found those rebels; we do not even know if they are still on the face of Arx, as they were only heard of that one time. Nevertheless, the Order assures us that they can still feel the presence of Krahoz in the fortress..."
"player_statue_good_news","Very well, I will find Krahoz and Zohark..."
"king_statue_now_go_save_misc 1","Now go, Am Shaegar: and save us from this demon. Find Krahoz and Zohark and destroy this accursed meteor once and for all..."
"king_statue_now_go_save_misc 2","You must find Krahoz and Zohark, the only way we can destroy this meteor."
"king_statue_now_go_save_misc 3","Find Krahoz and Zohark, Am Shaegar. Then you will finally be able to destroy the meteor..."
"felnor_statue_now_go_save_misc 1","Am Shaegar, now you must go on your quest to find Krahoz and Zohark"
"felnor_statue_now_go_save_misc 2","Hurry to find Krahoz and Zohark, and destroy the meteor."
"felnor_statue_now_go_save_misc 3","Find Krahoz and Zohark, Am Shaegar, to save the kingdom."
"king_after_attack_thanks","Many thanks, Am Shaegar. You have saved the kingdom... We will be eternally grateful to you."
"player_after_attack_good_news","I have destroyed the meteor in the Temple of Akbaa."
"felnor_after_attack_afraid","I am afraid that this will not be enough to stop Akbaa from coming to Arx..."
"player_after_attack_for_nothing","But that is impossible. That meteor was his energy channel..."
"felnor_after_attack_usefull","What you have done was indispensable in weakening Akbaa. But, according to my estimations, Akbaa has had time to gather enough energy to attempt to incarnate here on Arx. I believe Iserbius has a secret den where he is preparing to invoke Akbaa and to offer his body as vessel for the incarnation."
"player_after_attack_stop_process","How can we prevent this from happening?"
"felnor_after_attack_kill_entity","We can't. The only way would have been to kill him before this fusion took place. It will take him some time to channel the immense energy of Akbaa, but during this process, he will be immune to most weapons... You will need the most powerful of all the eldritch weapons in existence to confront this abomination and destroy the link between Iserbius and Akbaa."
"player_after_attack_where_weapon","Where can I find this weapon?"
"felnor_after_attack_not_exist","I'm afraid no such weapon exists... You must have one forged for this specific purpose. There is a book called 'The Theory of the Ultimate Weapon' which explains how to create such a weapon. You will need it."
"player_after_attack_my_best","I will act as quickly as possible."
"player_after_attack_weapon","I have the weapon."
"king_after_attack_weapon","Perfect, Am Shaegar. Now you must find the traitor Iserbius and banish this monster from Arx."
"king_after_attack_keep_weapon_misc 1","You must create this legendary weapon, Am Shaegar..."
"king_after_attack_keep_weapon_misc 2","Time is against us, Am Shaegar. You must forge this weapon."
"king_after_attack_keep_weapon_misc 3","This weapon will be able to destroy Akbaa for good."
"king_after_attack_akbaa_misc 1","Now you must find and destroy Akbaa."
"king_after_attack_akbaa_misc 2","The time has come to confront Akbaa and destroy him."
"king_after_attack_akbaa_misc 3","Am Shaegar, it is time to hunt down Akbaa and destroy him once and for all."
"player_show_diary01","Majesty, I must tell you that Carlo was involved in the death of your wife..."
"king_show_diary01","What did you say? Show me those papers..."
"player_show_diary02","Here..."
"king_show_diary02","Great heavens!... A traitor... Carlo... And I thought him my friend. Please leave me alone a moment. My guards will take care of this..."
"king_show_diary02_misc 1","Leave me alone for a moment, I beg of you."
"king_show_diary02_misc  2","I need to be alone for a moment."
"king_show_diary02_misc 3","Please, I must have time to reflect on this..."
"king_show_diary03","I understand what Carlo did: he thought he was doing what was best for the kingdom. However, I will never be able to forgive him."
"player_show_florence_letter","This is the letter that Carlo had found and which caused him to take such action."
"king_show_florence_letter","Thank you. I will read it later. Right now, I am still having trouble accepting so many years of lies."
"player_after_slap01","I don't understand any of this. What was this conversation about?"
"king_after_slap01","Listen: no offense, but I think it would be best if you stayed out of this. This concerns something internal to the kingdom."
"carlo_hello_stranger","I am Carlo, captain of the guards."
"player_greetings_carlo","I have an urgent message for the King."
"carlo_hello_stranger2","Our King, His Majesty Lunshire, is in the throne room. Go into the castle, through the double door of the room with columns. The King should be there..."
"carlo_find_king_misc 1","The King is in the throne room."
"carlo_find_king_misc 2","Go to the throne room. That's where you'll find the King."
"carlo_find_king_misc 3","Have you looked in the throne room?"
"carlo_excuse_me","Please forgive the vulgarity of my men, but they are good soldiers, above all else. They want to be sure that no goblin or Ylside gets past the castle gates."
"player_are_the_goblins","Are the goblins your enemies?"
"carlo_not_really","Well, not really. As a rule, we tolerate them. Sometimes we need them to trade gemstones and other things, but relations with them go no further."
"player_what_about_ylside","And what about the Ylsides?"
"carlo_know_nothing","Every time we find out more about them, it costs us dear in human lives. They are formidable fighters, powerful and merciless. We must be on our guard - they are dangerous enemies of the realm."
"carlo_sorry_no_time_misc 1","I'm sorry, but really, I have no time for you."
"carlo_sorry_no_time_misc 2","I haven't got time to chat. I have to coordinate the whole castle's defences."
"carlo_sorry_no_time_misc 3","I'm a bit busy planning the castle's defence at the moment..."
"player_any_news_misc","Do you have anything to tell me about the rituals?"
"carlo_no_am_shaggar 1","No, Am Shaegar, no news."
"carlo_no_am_shaggar 2","No, Am Shaegar, I can't tell you anything you don't already know..."
"carlo_no_am_shaggar 3","I have already told you everything I know, Am Shaegar."
"player_need_enter_crypt","I must continue my research in the crypt. Would you open the door for me?"
"carlo_here_the_key","I will give you a key to the crypt. Be careful, though - it's a very dangerous place. May the gods protect you..."
"player_carlo_murderer","Carlo, you must take responsibility for your crime."
"carlo_damn","My God, where did you find that?"
"player_carlo_accusation","That's of no importance. Do you admit to it?"
"carlo_yes","Yes, I admit it... But all this, I did all of it for the good of the kingdom... I found out that the Queen belonged to a secret order... The Order of the Sacred Dagger..."
"player_carlo_best_solution","And you thought that killing the Queen was the best solution. Did you not think to tell the King what you had discovered?..."
"carlo_dont_know","Sometimes the truth hurts more than a lie. I think the King would have died of grief had he known that his wife wanted to have him assassinated. Here, take this letter. You will have a clearer understanding of what I mean."
"carlo_regret","I hope the King will be able to forgive me. I did it all for him..."
"mopak_introducing","Welcome, stranger, my name is Mopak! I buy and sell all sorts of things. Pick up what takes your fancy. If you want to sell me something, put the object in my coffers and I will make you an offer..."

"player_calpale_well_actually","Actually, I am having trouble with my memory. Can you tell me who I am?"
"calpale_i_cant","Heh, heh... you're a trusting soul.  Sorry, friend, but as I said, I've never laid eyes on you before.  No one around here look familiar to you?  Maybe you were with the Guild of Travellers and some horrible disaster befell them, leaving you to wander around traumatized...  Or maybe some thug hit you on the head and lifted yer purse.  Who's to say?"
"player_calpale_then_what","Well then, tell me about this place..."
"calpale_ok_we","Well, this here is a bar, folks come in here to drink and complain... but maybe you meant the bigger picture?  You must have really smacked your noggin...  We live down here in these old mines because our sun flared out some years ago and left the topside world a frozen wasteland."
"player_calpale_how_many","But how many people live here? And where can I find this Guild of Travellers that I might belong to?"
"calpale_i_dont_know","Y'know, I'm not really sure just how many of us there are crammed down here...  besides us men, you've got yer goblins, dwarves, trolls... then you've got different factions of each... hard to say, really.  As for the Travellers' Guild, they're a bunch of hard-to-kill bastards who keep the lines of communication and trade open between us and all the other rat-hole cities.  It's supposed to be a long, tough trek between cities, so we don't see them too often, it may be a while before we see another group."

"chinkashh_these_rituals","Darkness pours from these rituals. The death of Falan Orbiplanax has all the signs of black magic and its evil practices. Falan was a good man, righteous and steadfast. I suppose he found out the truth about who is carrying out these rituals."

Although I would not wish to guide your destiny, Am Shaegar, let me suggest a valuable aid. Follow me and I will teach you the art of walking through the walls in this kingdom."
"chinkashh_portal02","On each of the kingdom's levels, my Sisters have set up a similar room. To use these portals, stand in front and chant the spell Activate Portal"

"Zalnashh_interesting","Interesting... And what made you thing the Order would want to allow such an object out of our possession for your sake?"
"player_need_zohark_guardian","It's quite simple: Akbaa is preparing to complete his reincarnation in Arx, and wreak systematic destruction on every living being in this dimension. I am the only one capable of stopping this process. But I need the legendary Zohark to help me..."
"Zalnashh_ah_ah_ah","Ah ha ha ha ha... Very good... But the core of the problem does not lie there, Guardian. Zohark is nothing without its brother, Krahoz: it is the union of these two objects that can protect your magical energy. And Krahoz was stolen by a group of rebels. Lunshire has consistently failed in all his attempts to get it back for us!!..."
"player_will_find_krahoz","I will find Krahoz."
"Zalnashh_you_will","You will find it... Unless perhaps you already have it... But that's not the problem. For now, destroying Akbaa has to be the priority. You must emerge victorious from the Discernment Challenge. It is an ordeal which must be attempted by each new recruit to our Order: You have to succeed in passing through the Temple of Illusions. If you do, you may take Zohark and you will also be protected against all the illusions Akbaa will try to use on you."
"Zalnashh_gives_orb_illusion","Here is the key to our temple, make good use of it"
"Zalnashh_krahoz_impressed","Krahoz... I am impressed, Guardian... This means that you also know where the rebels are hiding... Ahhh, tell me, tell me where they are hiding..."
"player_so_important","Why is that important? Krahoz is returned to you. That is all that matters."
"Zalnashh_you_right","You're right, Am Shaegar... Continue your quest to free Arx, but do not forget that if you ever need me, or any of our Order, we will have to make a deal with you... Now go."
"Zalnashh_keep_toy","You may keep this toy. Tell me where the rebels are hiding..."
"player_why_why","Why? Why is that so important to you?"
"Zalnashh_you_tell_us","Soon, you will tell us where their hideout is. You still have desperate need of our help, Guardian, so you will have no choice but to tell us this secret!"
"Zalnashh_bring_again","Am Shaegar. To what do we owe the honor of your visit?"
"player_slowned","Akbaa's coming to this dimension is imminent, even though the energy channel was destroyed. However, there is a way of stopping him. Will you help me?"
"Zalnashh_suuuure","Of cooouuuuuuuurrse we will... What wouldn't we do for you, beloved Guardian... Remember, though, that you must help us in return, when the moment arises... You need a magic weapon powerful enough to have an effect on the Koltk stone even when it is in resonance with Akbaa. To achieve this, you must forge this weapon out of an alloy containing Koltk powder. Then you will need a dragon's egg to complete the spell, for only this ingredient can retain the power of such a spell."
"player_return_soon","I will return soon..."
"player_have_egg","I have a dragon's egg."
"Zalnashh_still_weapon","Perfect. But you also need the weapon to cast the spell on."
"player_soon_possible","I will return as soon as I can."
"Zalnashh_here_weee","Aaah, heeere we aaare agaaaiiin, Am Shagaaar... Now I can cast a spell on the weapon... Put the weapon and the egg on the transmutation altar... I will perform the ritual. Ooooh, I nearly forgot: weren't you going to tell me where those rebels were hiding?..."
"player_another_way_snake","I see... Perhaps I can find another way..."

"Zalnashh_need_weapon 2","Do not forget to bring me a weapon if you want me to cast a spell on it."
"Zalnashh_need_weapon 3","The spell must be cast on a weapon. Bring one to me..."
"Zalnashh_please_tell_rebel 1","Before I cast the spell, you must tell me where the rebels' hideout is."
"Zalnashh_please_tell_rebel 2","Tell me where the rebels' hideout is if you want the spell cast on your weapon."
"Zalnashh_please_tell_rebel 3","Tell me where the rebels are hiding if you want a magic weapon."
"Zalnashh_new_queen 1","Thank you. Thanks to you, we have a new queen..."

"Fallan_intro_1","Listen to me, Beings of Light, and take note of what I have to say. This is Arx, which was once a city like so many others, spreading proudly beneath the majesty of the sun. Our king, Poxsellis, was a true and just king who knew how to deal with our occasional skirmishes with the goblins or the rat-men. Many years after Poxsellis's death, in the fatal year of 226, our sun began to fall into decline and an eternal winter fell upon our world... His Majesty Lunshire, noble son of Poxsellis, decided to move the whole city of Arx underground, into one of the dwarves' abandoned mines. At this point, the conflicts between the different races in Arx dissolved. Not just humans, but dwarves, trolls and goblins all worked together for their common survival. This migration underground took five years, during which the sun disappeared completely from our skies. All the races built their homes in this new setting, and little by little, relationships between the races began to slip back to the way they had always been. But today, evil is knocking at the gates..."
"Fallan_intro_2","Akbaa, the god of destruction, is about to... argghh!"

"Noden_servant_1","Lord, we have located an energy flux..."
"Sylib_noden_1","Another one... Why are the immortals never content with their own dimension?... But that is our eternal duty, I suppose; to ensure that the universal equilibrium is maintained. Where is the origin of the energy channel?"
"Noden_servant_2","An otherwise unremarkable world called Exosta. The supplicant expired before he could finish the communication.. What should we do, Lord?"
"Sylib_noden_2","Let us send a Guardian..."
"Sylib_briefing_1","Welcome, Guardian. Allow me to explain your next mission. You know the rules of the Noden, the dimension of gods and demon princes. No being of power is permitted to leave this dimension. But Akbaa is preparing to invade a world called Arx. A group of his followers is presently trying to invoke him. You know that this must not be. We cannot fight Akbaa from here, for we can impose nothing on the gods. So, we will send you to destroy this cult which worships him, and without the adulation of followers, his power will diminish to acceptable levels..."
"player_noden_briefing_1","I will destroy this cult, Master."
"Sylib_briefing_2","It will be no simple task. For this mission, we will confer upon you a specific skill to allow you to destroy the Koltk rock which is linked to Akbaa's power. It is impervious to mortal attack. This rock is the source of the problem, as it channels the energy given by Akbaa's followers. Soon, Akbaa will have enough energy to enable him to complete his incarnation on Arx."
"player_noden_briefing_2","I understand, Master... Will I have a contact in Arx?"
"Sylib_briefing_3","Your contact died during the transmission of his message. You will have to find your own way when you get there. This is extremely troublesome, as the shock of the passage is disastrous for a Guardian's memory. You may be disoriented for a while before your memory returns and you recall this conversation. But there is no other way..."
"Sylib_noden_briefing_4","Prepare yourself, you are about to be transported. I will bring you back when you have completed your mission..."
"Erzog_iserbius","Have mercy, Master, he threatened me... mercy..."
"Iserbius_erzog","Come, come, Erzog, you know full well that we must all do our bit for the cause with what feeble powers each of us possesses... But take comfort: Your modest sacrifice will not be in vain..."
"Iserbius_call_ylside","Incompetents! The Guardian has escaped!! Leave this pathetic kingdom to the humans and return to our refuge immediately!"
"Iserbius_call_ylside_2","Guardian, I know you can hear me, for you wear the armor of one of my fold... The traitor Kultar saved you this time..."
"Iserbius_call_ylside_3","You are in luck, Guardian, but it will not last. Nothing in Arx can stop the coming of my master. It's already too late! Akbaa and I are almost there..."
"Akbaa_dream_1","Ahhhhhh.... Mmmmhhhh... Come to me... I need you... Give your life to me..."
"Akbaa_dream_2","Guardian! Nothing can stop my incarnation on Arx now! It is far too late!  But why should we fight? Join me! You, too, are also a prisoner of the Noden and I alone can free you. Do you not crave freedom? Why remain a slave to the Noden when we could reign supreme over this world like gods? Be my ally, Guardian, and I promise you access to power beyond your dreams..."
"Akbaa_dream_3","Very well, Guardian... I see that you have rejected my generous offer... Perhaps our next meeting will see you bitterly regretting your decision... Did you really think that destroying this meteor would stop my incarnation? The remaining channel is just enough for me to follow, I may not have the strength that the sacrifice of these pathetic followers would have given me, but when I arrive, my energy will quickly grow strong with all these souls to drink..."
"King_Alia_destiny_1","My beautiful daughter, Alia! I had lost all hope of ever seeing you again..."

"King_Alia_destiny_3bis","Good heavens, what are you doing here? You have what you want: Krahoz is back in your hands, so I don't know what you think you're doing here..."
"Zalnashh_Alia_destiny_8","What has this to do with Krahoz? We are here to celebrate the return of Alia among her own, her true family: our Order..."
"King_Alia_destiny_6","Have you lost your mind?"
"Zalnashh_Alia_destiny_7","Perhaps you've lost your memory? Behold this treaty- the very pact agreed between our two peoples by Poxsellis, your father: 'In the name of the kingdom, I, King Poxsellis, King of Arx, pledge my fourth direct descendant to the Order of Edurneum, in return, the Order will provide the Kingdom with Krahoz and Zohark.' This child was promised to us, Lunshire. Let her come with us, or prepare to die!"
"King_Alia_destiny_4bis","Never! I was aware of  no such treaty. I refute it entirely! What cause could you have to take my daughter? Guards!"
"Zalnashh_Alia_destiny_3","Don't be rash, Lunshire. Have some sense for a change... What good are your swords against us? I thought you were a little more intelligent than that... This treaty was to ensure the rebirth of our queen. It just happened to save your pathetic kingdom as well. We need a queen, and that queen is Alia..."
"King_Alia_destiny_7","Alia will be queen... But queen of the humans! Comrades, fight to the death!"
"Alia_alia_destiny_3","Enough! No more bloodshed. I will honor Poxsellis's word. I know not what lies in store for me in the Order of Edurneum, but it is not for me to bring judgement upon this treaty... The kingdom would never have won the War of the Magi without the Order's help, and we must honor our promises. Father, I accept this,  because in my eyes, honor is the most important quality. I hope we will meet again soon, but I am afraid I must leave you now..."
"florence_alia_destiny_1","That will not be necessary..."
"Zalnashh_Alia_destiny_4","Fffff??"
"human_guards_Alia_destiny_4 1","Ooohhh?"
"human_guards_Alia_destiny_4 2","Aahh!"
"human_guards_Alia_destiny_4 3","aaahhhhh"
"King_alia_destiny_4","Florence? Is that you?..."
"florence_alia_destiny_2","I am sorry to interrupt your reunion, O Sisters of Edurneum, but Alia cannot be your queen... Alia is the fifth descendant of Poxsellis..."
"King_Alia_destiny_5","What?..."
"florence_alia_destiny_3","I was part of the Order of the Sacred Dagger, a secret order created by Poxsellis himself to protect the Kingdom of Arx against all sorts of dangers. I was an important officer of the organization, one of the few who knew about the secret treaty. I arranged for Alia to be kidnapped. But the night she was born, I also gave birth to Clarisse, her twin sister, born a few minutes before Alia. This unexpected birth gave me the idea of putting her into the care of my servant, who could take her out of Arx to the Guild of Travellers.  But I was assassinated by an unexpected visitor, who has finally been unmasked thanks to Am Shaegar."
"Zalnashh_Alia_destiny_5","Betrayed! And for so many years! Does human duplicity know no bounds? Where is the fourth descendant promised in our prophecy?"
"florence_alia_destiny_4","The true queen will reveal herself of her own accord, when the time is right..."
"Zalnashh_Alia_destiny_6","I am deeply disappointed... What a waste of time! We have been waiting for our queen for so many years... Sisters, let us return. Our race is dying out and we have nothing left to do here!"
"Iserbius_akbaa_final_fight","You come seconds too late: now I can face you in combat, Guardian... I will never return to the Noden, but you, on the other hand, are about to return there right now!"
"akbaa_final_fight","You come seconds too late: now I can face you in combat, Guardian... I will never return to the Noden, but you, on the other hand, are about to return there right now!"
"Iserbius_akbaa_die","Noooooo, how did you?.... Ahhhhh, NoooooOOOOOoooo..."
"player_akbaa_die","I look forward to seeing you in the Noden, Akbaa..."
"Iserbius_die_1","What have you done? Akbaa may have been evil, but he was the only one who could bring the sun back to Arx..."
"player_iserbius_die","Akbaa should not have tried to manifest in this dimension. He knows the rules..."
"Sylib_guardian_endgame_1","Rules which you, too, must follow, Guardian..."
"player_sylib_endgame_1","Master!? ...What do you mean?"
"Sylib_guardian_endgame_2","The rules are set in stone and cannot be broken, Guardian. You were sent by the Noden and must return there the moment your mission has been completed..."
"player_sylib_endgame_2","And Arx's sun? Was Iserbius telling the truth?"
"Sylib_guardian_endgame_3","Do not worry about this phenomenon. Quite simply, it is not within the Noden's power. Also, things may not be as you have perceived them. I know you have been through powerful experiences here, but the power you have acquired makes you too dangerous for this world. The consequences of your staying here any longer could be disastrous. And I have many other missions for you. Allow me to bring you back within our fold..."
"player_sylib_endgame_3","Very good, Master."
